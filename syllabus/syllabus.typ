== Course Description
Basic principles of thermodynamics, mechanics of fluids, oscillatory motion, mechanical waves.

== Course Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this course, each student should be able to:

    - Describe, interpret and predict characteristics of simple harmonic oscillators using multiple graphical representations, mathematical models, and experimental data.
    - Describe, interpret and predict the propagation of energy via waves, using applied conservation of energy principles.
    - Explain predictions of high and low intensity locations for two interfering coherent wave sources.
    - Locate nodes and anti-nodes in standing wave patterns in strings and sounds in tubes both in the laboratory and by mathematical modeling of the standing wave.
    - Describe and predict the location and mathematically characterize the formation of an image using the thin lens model and ray tracing optics analysis for images formed by reflection and refraction.
    - Compare and contrast the evidence for the wave versus particle nature of electromagnetic waves.
    - Apply specific strategies to solving multi-part physics problems relating to the study of wave phenomena (e.g., drawing, labeling, abstract representations for analytical purposes utilizing methods other than mathematical models, articulating assumptions, applying appropriate physics principles, applying correct mathematical analysis, assessment of the reasonableness of a solution).

== Required Textbooks & Resources
- _Physics for Scientists and Engineers with Modern Physics, Randall Knight, 5th edition, Pearson_
- Access to MasteringPhysics.com for homework.
- Graphing or scientific calculator e.g. handheld, Desmos, Wolfram|Alpha, etc.

== Grading
The grading scheme for this course is as follows

- MasteringPhysics -- 30%
- Labs -- 30%
- Worksheets -- 30%
- Final Project -- 10%

== MasteringPhysics
MasteringPhysics is the assessment tool we will use for homeworks/assignments.  MasteringPhysics will be due the Monday following the end of the topic (typically Friday).  These assignments can take significant time; it is suggested to start during the week and continue as the topics are covered.

== Labs

== Worksheets

== Final Project

== Student Conduct Expectations
This course includes elements that require not only your physical presence, but also your mental presence. The work we will do in this course is highly technical and collaborative; be prepared to engage with the content and your peers every day.

== Course Schedule
TBD

== Guidelines for Contacting the Instructor
The best way to contact me is via email or in office hours.  I intend to be unavailable outside of conventional working hours, but will otherwise get back to you as soon as I can.  *Note:* If you expect to be unable to come to class for less than three meetings, there is no need to let me know.

== Attendance
There is no intrinsic penalty for lack of attendance in this course.  Instead, it is up to the student to keep up on any material covered in class while away; this material will be posted on Canvas prior to being covered in class.  As for labs, materials to complete labs outside of class time are available in the Math Center (LRN 340).  While attendence is not required, it is highly suggested as collaboration with peers and participating with in-class activities is paramount to success.

== Late Work Policy
There is no intrinsic penalty for late work in this course.  Instead, assignments will be due periodically but remain open (i.e. able to accept submissions) until the end of the quarter.

== Core Learning Abilities
WCC's core learning abilities (CLAs) - communicating, information literacy, quantitative reasoning, social justice, and thinking - are overarching skills that are taught and reinforced throughout our curriculum and a student's time at WCC. These skills are integral to students' professional and personal lives. This course will give you the opportunity to practice and develop one or more of these core learning abilities.

== Access and Disability Services
Any student with a disability requiring auxiliary aids, services, or other reasonable accommodations should contact the access and disability
services office in Laidlaw 134 to make an appointment (`ads@whatcom.edu`, 360.383.3139, or 711 relay service for deaf callers). 

== Affirmation of Inclusion
WCC is committed to maintaining an environment in which every member of the College community feels welcome to participate in the life of the  College, free from harassment and discrimination. We welcome people of all races, ethnicity, national origins, religions, ages, genders, sexua orientations, marital status, veteran status, abilities, and disabilities. Toward that end, faculty, students, and staff will treat one another with respect and dignity; promote a learning and working community that ensures social justice, understanding, civility and non-violence in a safe and supportive climate; and influence curriculum, teaching strategies, student services, and personnel practices that facilitate sensitivity and openness to diverse ideas, peoples and cultures in a creative, safe, and collegial environment.

== Non-Discrimination Policy, Title IX, and Sexual Misconduct
WCC does not discriminate based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, honorably discharged veteran or military status, sexual orientation, genetic information, or age in its programs and activities. WCC's discrimination and harassment policy (615), Title IX [sexual misconduct and harassment] policy (616), and student rights and responsibilities policy (620) strictly prohibit sexual harassment, intimidation, and violence. Anyone who has experienced sexual misconduct is encouraged to contact a WCC counselor (Laidlaw 134, 360.383.3139) to receive confidential support and learn about reporting options. Any disclosure of such misconduct shared with another faculty or staff member is non confidential and requires a report to WCCâ€™s Title IX coordinator, who has been designated to handle such reports. Inquiries regarding non- discrimination, Title IX, and sexual misconduct policies can be directed to the Title IX coordinator at 360.383.3400. 

== Accommodations for reasons of faith or conscience
Students who will be absent from course activities due to reasons of faith or conscience may seek reasonable accommodations, so grades are not affected. Such requests must be made to the instructor within the first two weeks of the quarter and should specify the exact dates the student will miss. The instructor and student will then identify the specific reasonable accommodations for the missed class sessions.
